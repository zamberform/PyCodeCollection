## MultiWorker

I think I use a cool class to fix the problems in asynchronous processing.

you can use it like `multi_worker_sample.py` 

just do

```
python multi_worker_sample.py
```

* you should know your computer or container space.

  Just Use in MacOS
  
  ```
   system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
  ```
